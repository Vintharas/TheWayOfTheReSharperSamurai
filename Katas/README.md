Hi! Welcome to **The Way of the ReSharper Samurai** Katas!

The purpose of the different Katas is to learn and get comfortable with ReSharper. The Katas have been divided in three sections:

*  Improve (Katas_01_Improve)
*  Explorer (Katas_02_Explore)
*  Create (Katas_03_Create)

each one of them targeting the foundational and most important features of ReSharper.

You can start with whichever section you want, and repeat them as many times as you wish.

Finally, I have added some basic unit tests to ensure that your refactorings don't break the original functionality.

Have fun!!
